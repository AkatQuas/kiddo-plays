# Overview 

This is a command for creating project using self template/boilerplate.

If you need a command on your version, follow the code structure [here](./bin/dtt-react-cli-create.js) to start.

Most of the scripts are written in Promise-styled, which is kind of ugly.

A better structered project is [here](https://github.com/AkatQuas/create-cli).
