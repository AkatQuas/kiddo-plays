# Album-Manager

This is our module for managin photo albums based on a directory. We assume that, given a path, there is an albums sub-folder, and each of its individual sub-folders are themselves the albums. Files in thos sub-folders are photos.

## Album Manager

The album manager exposes a single function, `albums`, which returns an array of `Album` objects for each album it contains.

## Album Object

The album object has the following two prorperties and one method:
* `name` -- The name of the album
* `path` -- The path to the album
* `photos()` -- Calling this method will return all the album's photos
