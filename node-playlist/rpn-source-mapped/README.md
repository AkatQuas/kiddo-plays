# RPN with Source Map

> Inspired by the article: [Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/).

In this tutorial, we will be compiling a small [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), or RPN, language to JavaScript.

We are keeping the language simple so that we can focus on integrating source maps with the compiler, rather than language implementation details.

## Demo

Use VS Code tasks.

Run the `Demo` task with VS Code.

## Usage

```bash
$ npx rpn path-to-file.rpn
```
