# Test-Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development

Tests help us to write better programmes, better code.

In this project, we take a tour to several test framework, such as [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Some of them are very powerful, while others may be more flexible, choose the one that meets your requirements.

If you are new to test framework, please do start with `jasmine`, which provides [wonderful tutorial](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite)!

Personally, I perfer `expect` style assertion and `jasmine`.

[Testing library](https://testing-library.com/): Simple and complete testing utilities that encourage good testing practices.

## UI Library/Framework Tests

[angulest](angulest) is a project generated by _ng new_. Most of the test cases come from [this document](https://angular.io/guide/testing), which is a comprehensive guide for writing test in Angular with Jasmine.

[vuest](vuest/) is a project generated by _vue-cli_, there are many [unit test case examples](vuest/tests/unit/). Vue.js has its own test framework called [@vue/test-utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/). And there is a useful [handbook](https://lmiller1990.github.io/vue-testing-handbook/).

[react-enzyme](react-enzyme/) is a project generated by _create-react-app@3.x_, writing test with Jest and Enzyme.

[react-testing-lib](react-testing-lib/) is a project generated by _create-react-app@4.x_, writing test with Jest and React-Testing-Library.
