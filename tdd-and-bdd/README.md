# Test-Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development

Tests help us to write better programmes, better code.

In this project, we take a tour to several test framework, such as [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Some of them are very powerful, while others may be more flexible, choose the one that meets your requirements.

If you are new to test framework, please do start with `jasmine`, which provides [wonderful tutorial](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite)!

Personally, I perfer `expect` style assertion and `jasmine`.

## UI Library/Framework Tests

[angulest](angulest) is a project generated by *ng new*. Most of the test cases come from [this document](https://angular.io/guide/testing), which is a comprehensive guide for writing test in Angular with Jasmine.

[vuest](vuest/) is a project generated by *vue-cli*, there are many [unit test case examples](vuest/tests/unit/). Vue.js has its own test framework called [@vue/test-utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/). And there is a useful [handbook](https://lmiller1990.github.io/vue-testing-handbook/).

[reacest](reacest/) is a project generated by *create-react-app*, writing test with Jest and Enzyme.
