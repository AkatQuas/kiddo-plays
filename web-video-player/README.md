# HTML5 video player

There are not many video player libraries suitable for us.

Most of these libraries support both static video file playing and HLS streaming.

The plugins structure is a greate design for this.

Besides the video playing, the relevant control widgets, media codecs should make sense when developing such a library.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install


$ npm run start
```

There are three types of video example in this project. [xgplayer from bytedance](https://github.com/bytedance/xgplayer), [deprecated flv.js player from bilibili](https://github.com/bilibili/flv.js), [native HTML5 element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).
