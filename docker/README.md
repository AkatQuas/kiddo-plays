# Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a great technology to learn. It starts with one simple concept: packaging an application together with all its dependencies, so you can run that app in the same way anywhere. That concept makes your applications portable between laptops, data-centers, and clouds, and it breaks down barriers between development and operations teams.
