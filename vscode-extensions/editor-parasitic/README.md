# parasitic README

A VS Code extension "parasitic", just for fun.

## Features

Only one command registered in VS Code editor.

`parasitic.activate`

[微信开发者工具](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/devtools/devtools.html)，[抖音开发者工具](https://developer.open-douyin.com/docs/resource/zh-CN/mini-app/develop/developer-instrument/overview) are both vscode based. So it's possible to add custom extensions.
